# Part 1
Find the **top 10** most common words in the H.P. Lovecraft short story, [_The Night Ocean_](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/no.aspx).
Print each word out with the number of times it appears in the story.
Ignore upper and lower case, "The" and "the" should be treated as the same word.
Ignore all punctuation.

# Part 2
For part 2, change the report such that it displays each of the top 10 words **keeping the original case** of each word. Also print the number of occurances of each.

For example, if the two most common words are `the` and `fish` the first two lines of your report from **part 1** might look like this:

```
the: 229
fish: 130
```

For **part 2** they would look something like this:

```
the: 150, The 70, THE: 9
fish: 55, Fish: 75
```
